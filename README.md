## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Most front-end apps need a back-end as well. But when you are developing your new app, you might not want to code the back-end right away. Or maybe you want to be able to do testing without hitting the API, or having to spin up an instance of the API. In this case, consider simulating the back-end. Ember CLI Mirage is perfect for that.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will show you the different possibilities Ember CLI Mirage offers for easily simulating a back-end server in development and testing. You'll see how a back-end can be simulated for a real-life project and you'll see how to tailor this simulation for easy testing.
